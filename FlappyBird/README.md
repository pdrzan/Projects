# Flappy Bird

This project tries to imitate the Flappy Bird game. It was made for an html page, and all the interactions were made using javascript.

The idea for the project was taken from the Web Moderno course on the Cod3r platform. The fonts, the Flappy image, and the estilo.css file were taken from there.

If you want to play, just open the flappy.html file in your browser.
