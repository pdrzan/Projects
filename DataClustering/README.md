# Data Clustering

This project is a data clustering of 1 artificial database and 2 real databases. I used five algorithms in the analysis:

1. KMeans
2. Single Linkage
3. Complete Linkage
4. Average Linkage
5. Centroid Linkage

To make the artificial database, i used the *make_blobs* function of the *sklearn* library. I got the 2 other databases from the UCI machine learning datasets:
